Nicholas Piazza: Hi Sarah, can you hear me okay?

Sarah Chen: Yes, I can hear you. Just adjusting my headset real quick.

Nicholas Piazza: Perfect. Thanks so much for making time today. I know how busy it gets in the CCU. How's your morning been so far?

Sarah Chen: Oh, busy as always. Had a full unit last night, and we're still at capacity. But that's actually good timing for this discussion because we've been dealing with some challenges with the monitoring systems, especially during shift changes.

Nicholas Piazza: That's exactly what we want to learn more about. Could you walk me through a typical shift change and how you're using our monitoring systems?

Sarah Chen: Sure. So during shift change, we have to manage about 24 patients in our unit, all on continuous cardiac monitoring. We're using your CardioWatch system for most patients, and some are also on the older ECG units. The main challenge is that these don't talk to each other well. When we're handing off patients, we have to log into multiple systems to get a complete picture of a patient's cardiac status over the past 12 hours.

Nicholas Piazza: Could you give me a specific example of what that workflow looks like?

Sarah Chen: Yes, let me walk you through what happened just this morning. We had a patient who showed some arrhythmia on the CardioWatch around 3 AM. The night nurse had to document this in our EMR, but when we tried to pull up the specific waveform during rounds, we had to switch to your separate CardioAnalytics portal. Then, because this patient also had a 12-lead ECG done at 6 AM, that data was in yet another system. It took us about 15 minutes just to piece together the complete cardiac event timeline for one patient.

Nicholas Piazza: That sounds frustrating. How often do you need to cross-reference data between these different systems?

Sarah Chen: Multiple times every shift. And it's not just about viewing the data - it's about the alerts too. The CardioWatch will send alerts to our phones, but the ECG system only shows alerts on the central station monitor. Sometimes we get duplicate alerts, sometimes we miss alerts because they're only showing in one system. Our newer nurses especially struggle with this because they have to learn multiple systems just to monitor one patient's cardiac status.

Nicholas Piazza: What impact does this have on patient care? Can you walk me through a scenario where this has been particularly challenging?

Sarah Chen: Well, last week we had a complex case - a post-CABG patient who was showing intermittent ST changes. The CardioWatch caught some subtle changes, but because it doesn't automatically sync with the 12-lead ECG data, we didn't immediately notice a pattern developing. When the patient became symptomatic, we had to manually review data from both systems to show the progression to the cardiac team. Don't get me wrong - we caught it and the patient is fine, but it would have been much easier if we had one unified system. Plus, when we did our quality review afterward, compiling all the cardiac monitoring data from different timestamps and systems took hours.

Nicholas Piazza: That's really helpful context. How do you currently handle alert settings across these different systems?

Sarah Chen: That's another pain point. Each system has its own alert parameters. The CardioWatch is more customizable, which is great, but then those settings don't carry over to the ECG system. So if we adjust parameters for a patient who's in chronic AFib, for example, we have to remember to change it in multiple places. And when we transfer patients between units, all these settings reset. I'd say our nurses spend at least 30 minutes per shift just managing alert settings.

Nicholas Piazza: And what about the mobile aspect of the CardioWatch? How is that working for your team?

Sarah Chen: The mobile app is actually one of the better features. Being able to see waveforms on our phones is huge, especially when we're in isolation rooms or away from the central station. But there are still some limitations. Like, we can view the real-time data, but we can't access the trending data from the past 24 hours on mobile. And when we need to document something we saw on mobile, we still have to go back to a workstation to access the full system. Plus, the app sometimes logs us out randomly, which is really inconvenient when you're in the middle of patient care.

Nicholas Piazza: How long does it typically take to log back in when that happens?

Sarah Chen: The login itself is quick, maybe 30 seconds, but because of our hospital's security requirements, we often have to go through two-factor authentication again. And if you're in an isolation room in full PPE, having to take out your phone to get a security code is really disruptive. We've had nurses miss important alerts because they got logged out and couldn't quickly get back in. Some nurses have just started carrying their tablets instead of relying on the mobile app, which kind of defeats the purpose.

Nicholas Piazza: That's a great point about the PPE situation. I hadn't thought about that. Could you tell me more about how you use the analytics features in both systems?

Sarah Chen: The analytics capabilities are quite different between the systems. CardioWatch has some nice trending features, especially for arrhythmia tracking. But the ECG system is more basic - it really just stores the waveforms without much analysis. What we really need is something that can analyze data across both systems. For example, if a patient has been on continuous monitoring for three days, we want to easily see all cardiac events, regardless of which device captured them. Right now, preparing reports for cardiac team rounds means screenshots from multiple systems and manually creating timelines in Excel. It's time-consuming and there's always a risk of missing something.

Nicholas Piazza: And how do the physicians feel about having to access multiple systems?

Sarah Chen: Oh, they hate it. Most of them just rely on us nurses to compile everything for them. Dr. Martinez, our chief of cardiology, was just complaining about this last week. He wants to be able to quickly review a patient's cardiac status from home when he's on call, but right now that means multiple logins and switching between different interfaces. Sometimes he'll just ask us to text him screenshots because it's faster than logging into everything. Obviously, that's not ideal from a security standpoint.

Nicholas Piazza: What about training new staff on these systems? How do you handle that?

Sarah Chen: Training is actually one of our biggest challenges. New nurses already have so much to learn, and now we have to train them on multiple monitoring systems with different interfaces, different alert parameters, different documentation requirements. We've created our own quick-reference guides because the official training materials don't address how to coordinate between the systems. And when we get floating nurses from other units, they might be familiar with one system but not the other. We usually have to assign an experienced nurse to buddy with them just to help manage the monitoring systems.

Nicholas Piazza: If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about these systems, what would be your top priorities?

Sarah Chen: First would definitely be integration - one system that handles both continuous monitoring and 12-lead ECGs, with a single login and consistent interface. Second would be better mobile functionality that stays logged in and gives us access to all the same features we have at the workstation. And third would be smarter analytics that can help us spot trends and patterns across all the cardiac data. We spend so much time just trying to piece together information that the system should be correlating for us automatically.

Nicholas Piazza: This has been incredibly helpful, Sarah. Would it be okay if we followed up with you once we have some potential solutions to these issues?

Sarah Chen: Of course! We'd be happy to provide feedback on any improvements. And if you need to observe our workflow firsthand, you're welcome to come shadow our team. Just let me know in advance so I can coordinate with our unit manager and infection control.
