00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
David Chang: Hi Lisa, thanks for making time today.
2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:08.529
Lisa Chen: Hi David. Happy to discuss our supply chain challenges.
3
00:00:09.130 --> 00:00:20.840
David Chang: I understand you manage procurement for cardiac equipment across ten hospitals. Could you give me an overview of your role?
4
00:00:21.240 --> 00:01:00.560
Lisa Chen: Sure. I oversee all medical device procurement and inventory management for our healthcare system. For cardiac equipment alone, we're managing relationships with 15 major vendors, tracking about $50 million in capital equipment, and handling roughly $12 million annually in consumables and accessories. The complexity has increased dramatically in recent years, especially with networked devices and software licensing requirements.

5
00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:15.300
David Chang: How do you approach capital equipment planning across such a large system?

6
00:01:15.800 --> 00:02:15.400
Lisa Chen: Capital planning is incredibly complex now. We're not just buying boxes anymore - each purchase decision has long-term implications for IT infrastructure, training, maintenance, and consumables. Take your CardioWatch system for example. When we plan a system-wide deployment, we have to consider the initial hardware costs, sure, but also network upgrades, software licenses, service contracts, electrode costs over the life of the units, and compatibility with existing equipment. We use a total cost of ownership model that looks at a 7-year horizon, though technology often forces replacements sooner.

7
00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:30.300
David Chang: What challenges do you face with standardization across facilities?

8
00:02:30.800 --> 00:03:30.400
Lisa Chen: Standardization is a major focus but faces several obstacles. Each hospital has its own historical vendor relationships and user preferences. Our level 1 trauma centers have different needs than our community hospitals. Plus, we can rarely replace everything simultaneously due to budget constraints. So we end up with planned variation - core standardization for basic monitoring, but some flexibility for specialized units. The challenge is managing this variation without losing the economies of scale in purchasing and maintenance.

9
00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:45.300
David Chang: How do you handle vendor negotiations for large-scale purchases?

10
00:03:45.800 --> 00:04:45.400
Lisa Chen: Vendor negotiations have become more complex with these integrated systems. We're not just negotiating purchase price - we're looking at long-term partnership agreements that cover everything from implementation support to future upgrades. Service contract terms are particularly crucial. We need guaranteed response times, parts availability, and software support. We also focus heavily on training provisions - both initial and ongoing. And with the shift toward subscription-based features, we're seeing more complex licensing terms that need careful review.

11
00:04:46.000 --> 00:05:00.300
David Chang: What about inventory management for consumables and accessories?

12
00:05:00.800 --> 00:06:00.400
Lisa Chen: Consumables management is actually one of our biggest daily challenges. Take cardiac monitoring electrodes - we use about 2.5 million annually across our system. Each type of monitor needs specific electrodes, and they have shelf life limitations. We've implemented RFID tracking and automated par level management, but it's still complex. Supply chain disruptions during COVID really highlighted our vulnerabilities. We've increased our safety stock levels and diversified suppliers where possible, but some components are single-source from the device manufacturer.

13
00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:15.300
David Chang: How do you handle software licensing and updates across the system?

14
00:06:15.800 --> 00:07:15.400
Lisa Chen: Software management has become a significant part of our procurement strategy. We're seeing more features moved to subscription models, which affects both budgeting and contract management. We need to track license compliance across thousands of devices, manage renewal dates, and ensure we're not paying for unused features. Updates are another challenge - coordinating system-wide software rollouts requires careful planning with clinical operations. We're also seeing more costs shifted to software and less to hardware, which affects how we structure our capital versus operational budgets.

15
00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:30.300
David Chang: What processes do you have for evaluating new technology?

16
00:07:30.800 --> 00:08:30.400
Lisa Chen: Technology evaluation has become much more rigorous. We have a formal value analysis committee that includes clinical, technical, and financial stakeholders. For major systems like cardiac monitoring, we do extensive pilot testing before committing to system-wide deployment. We look at clinical outcomes, user satisfaction, technical reliability, and total cost impact. Integration capabilities are crucial - any new system needs to work with our existing infrastructure. We also consider future scalability and upgrade paths. The challenge is balancing innovation with standardization and cost control.

17
00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:45.300
David Chang: How do you manage emergency and backup inventory?

18
00:08:45.800 --> 00:09:45.400
Lisa Chen: Emergency inventory management is critical, especially for cardiac care. We maintain a strategic reserve of critical equipment and supplies, rotated regularly to prevent obsolescence. Each facility has backup monitors and modules, but managing their distribution and readiness is complex. We learned a lot from COVID about emergency stockpile management. Now we have more formal agreements with vendors for emergency access to supplies and equipment. We've also improved our internal equipment sharing processes between facilities during crises.

19
00:09:46.000 --> 00:10:00.300
David Chang: What about cost containment strategies?

20
00:10:00.800 --> 00:11:00.400
Lisa Chen: Cost containment requires a delicate balance. We leverage our system size for volume discounts, but also need to maintain vendor relationships. We've implemented various strategies - standardizing where possible, optimizing inventory levels, extending equipment lifecycles where safe. But some costs are rising regardless. Cybersecurity requirements add significant expense. Training costs increase with system complexity. And with more software-based features, we're seeing ongoing operational costs replace traditional capital expenses. We're constantly evaluating the right balance between in-house and vendor-provided services.

21
00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:15.300
David Chang: How do you handle regulatory compliance in procurement?

22
00:11:15.800 --> 00:12:15.400
Lisa Chen: Regulatory compliance affects every aspect of procurement. We need to ensure all purchased equipment meets current standards and has appropriate documentation. Contract language around regulatory compliance is crucial - who's responsible for updates if requirements change? How quickly must vendors respond to security vulnerabilities? We also track all device modifications and updates for regulatory purposes. And with international supply chains, we need to consider various regulatory frameworks. Documentation requirements have increased significantly, especially around cybersecurity and data privacy.

23
00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:30.300
David Chang: What challenges do you face with service contract management?

24
00:12:30.800 --> 00:13:30.400
Lisa Chen: Service contract management has become incredibly complex. We're managing hundreds of contracts with varying terms, coverage levels, and renewal dates. Response time requirements vary by department and device criticality. Some contracts include regular technology refreshes, others don't. We're trying to standardize terms across vendors where possible, but each has their own approach. Remote monitoring and predictive maintenance features are changing how we structure service agreements. We're also seeing more hybrid models where we handle first-line support but need vendor backup for complex issues.

25
00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:45.300
David Chang: How do you approach end-of-life planning for equipment?

26
00:13:45.800 --> 00:14:45.400
Lisa Chen: End-of-life planning starts at procurement. We need to understand the expected lifecycle, upgrade paths, and eventual replacement costs. Software support often determines end-of-life more than hardware condition now. We try to plan replacements in phases to spread out capital costs, but this requires careful coordination with clinical operations. Data migration is a major consideration - ensuring patient data is properly archived and accessible. We also need to consider secure data destruction when retiring equipment. The challenge is timing replacements across facilities while maintaining standardization.

27
00:14:46.000 --> 00:15:00.300
David Chang: What about tracking ongoing maintenance costs?

28
00:15:00.800 --> 00:16:00.400
Lisa Chen: Maintenance cost tracking has become more sophisticated. We track both vendor service costs and internal support expenses. This data feeds into our total cost of ownership calculations and helps inform future purchasing decisions. We're seeing some interesting trends - newer equipment often has lower hardware maintenance costs but higher software support costs. We're also tracking downtime costs more carefully now, including clinical impact and workflow disruption. This helps justify preventive maintenance investments and upgrade decisions.

29
00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:15.300
David Chang: How do you manage relationships with multiple vendors?

30
00:16:15.800 --> 00:17:15.400
Lisa Chen: Vendor relationship management is crucial for long-term success. We have formal quarterly business reviews with major vendors, tracking performance metrics, discussing issues, and planning future needs. We try to maintain competition while also building strategic partnerships. Integration requirements often force us to work with specific vendors, so maintaining leverage in negotiations is important. We've developed scorecards that track various metrics - response times, parts availability, training quality, technical support effectiveness. This helps keep relationships objective and focused on continuous improvement.

31
00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:30.300
David Chang: What about managing consumable costs over time?

32
00:17:30.800 --> 00:18:30.400
Lisa Chen: Consumable cost management is an ongoing challenge. We often see significant price increases over time, especially for proprietary items like specialized electrodes or sensor cables. We try to negotiate price caps in initial contracts, but vendors resist long-term commitments. We're also seeing more sophisticated consumables with embedded technology, which drives up costs. Standardization helps with volume discounts, but we need to balance that against clinical preferences and special needs. We're exploring reprocessing programs for some items, but that's limited by manufacturer restrictions.

33
00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:45.300
David Chang: How do you handle budget planning and forecasting?

34
00:18:45.800 --> 00:19:45.400
Lisa Chen: Budget planning has become more complex with these integrated systems. We need to forecast both capital and operational expenses, including software licenses, consumables, and maintenance costs. We use historical data and trend analysis, but technology changes can make past patterns less relevant. We're also dealing with more subscription-based costs that blur the line between capital and operational expenses. Clinical volume projections affect both equipment needs and consumable usage. We're developing more sophisticated forecasting models that consider multiple variables.

35
00:19:46.000 --> 00:20:00.300
David Chang: What about managing user training resources?

36
00:20:00.800 --> 00:21:00.400
Lisa Chen: Training resource management is a significant part of our procurement strategy. We negotiate comprehensive training packages with vendors, including initial training, ongoing updates, and train-the-trainer programs. We're seeing more demand for online and simulation-based training, which affects both costs and delivery methods. We need to ensure training resources are available across all shifts and locations. We're also building internal training capabilities to reduce dependency on vendor resources, but that requires maintaining our own expertise as systems evolve.

37
00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:15.300
David Chang: How do you handle integration requirements in purchasing decisions?

38
00:21:15.800 --> 00:22:15.400
Lisa Chen: Integration requirements heavily influence our purchasing decisions. Any new equipment needs to work with our existing systems - EMR, PACS, central monitoring, and various clinical information systems. We've learned to be very specific about integration requirements in RFPs and contracts. We need detailed technical specifications and often require proof of integration capabilities before purchase. We also consider future integration needs - will this equipment work with systems we're planning to implement? Integration testing has become a major part of our procurement process.

39
00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:30.300
David Chang: What about managing equipment configurations across facilities?

40
00:22:30.800 --> 00:23:30.400
Lisa Chen: Configuration management across multiple facilities is extremely challenging. Each facility might need slightly different setups based on their patient population and staff preferences. But too much variation increases support costs and complexity. We try to standardize core configurations while allowing some local customization. We maintain a central database of all configurations and changes. When we deploy new equipment or updates, we need to ensure all configuration changes are properly documented and validated. This becomes particularly complex with networked devices that share configurations.

41
00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:45.300
David Chang: How do you see AI and automation affecting procurement?

42
00:23:45.800 --> 00:24:45.400
Lisa Chen: AI and automation are starting to impact our procurement processes. We're implementing AI-driven inventory management systems that can predict usage patterns and optimize ordering. Automated contract management tools help track renewal dates and compliance requirements. We're also seeing more AI features in the equipment itself, which adds new considerations to purchasing decisions. We need to evaluate the reliability of AI features and understand their impact on workflow and training needs. There's also the question of ongoing AI model updates and how those are handled in service contracts.

43
00:24:46.000 --> 00:25:00.300
David Chang: What improvements would make your job easier?

44
00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:45.400
Lisa Chen: Better standardization across vendors would help tremendously - in terms of integration protocols, service metrics, and contract terms. We need more sophisticated tools for managing the complete lifecycle of medical devices, from initial procurement through retirement. More transparency in pricing and better predictability in ongoing costs would improve our planning. And as systems become more complex, we need better ways to evaluate total cost of ownership and return on investment. The industry needs to move toward more standardized approaches to software licensing and updates.

45
00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.300
David Chang: This has been incredibly informative, Lisa. Thank you for your time.

46
00:25:55.800 --> 00:26:00.500
Lisa Chen: You're welcome. Hope this helps improve future product planning.
