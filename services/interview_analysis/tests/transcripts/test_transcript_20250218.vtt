00:00:27.900 --> 00:00:29.449
Harry Liu: Hey? Good morning, Isaac!

2
00:00:30.910 --> 00:00:31.380
Isaac Park: Hey, Eric.

3
00:00:32.060 --> 00:00:32.959
Harry Liu: How are you?

4
00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:34.280
Isaac Park: Good! How are you?

5
00:00:34.640 --> 00:00:36.320
Harry Liu: Amazing. Yeah. Long time to see.

6
00:00:36.490 --> 00:00:38.260
Isaac Park: Yeah, yeah. It's been a little bit.

7
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:44.820
Harry Liu: Yeah, just to make sure that you're you're conscious of your time. We have like, 30Â min.

8
00:00:45.020 --> 00:00:45.790
Isaac Park: Yep. Yep.

9
00:00:45.790 --> 00:00:46.360
Harry Liu: Clip.

10
00:00:46.460 --> 00:01:01.190
Harry Liu: Thanks. Yes, thanks so much for taking the time. So I'm in 2 pm. 2, this semester. We've definitely missed you. Yeah, it's really a good class. I loved it, and we're working with Nick and Kweku like, which you probably already know.

11
00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.290
Harry Liu: Yeah, on their suite of products. So

12
00:01:05.670 --> 00:01:13.760
Harry Liu: like, there, you already know, they're building something for the innovative economy. They're trying to like build tools for people like to, you know.

13
00:01:13.950 --> 00:01:20.269
Harry Liu: get better in terms of knowing what to build and how to build things.

14
00:01:20.460 --> 00:01:25.840
Harry Liu: Initially. We were tasked with this thing to like build an AI tile prompter for the user interview process. But then.

15
00:01:25.840 --> 00:01:27.160
Isaac Park: To build. A what a what.

16
00:01:27.160 --> 00:01:28.880
Harry Liu: AI teleprompter.

17
00:01:29.580 --> 00:01:31.040
Isaac Park: AI teleprompter.

18
00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:31.600
Harry Liu: Yeah.

19
00:01:31.870 --> 00:01:42.719
Harry Liu: for the user interview process. To kind of like, the idea was to guide like people on their like during their user interviews. So they can like, you know, as.

20
00:01:42.720 --> 00:01:43.810
Isaac Park: Oh, I see. Okay.

21
00:01:43.810 --> 00:01:57.928
Harry Liu: On track, etcetera, but also like they specifically want us to explore the healthcare life sciences, space, because that they think that is a good area to tackle into like a more hard to tackle industry, I guess.

22
00:01:58.450 --> 00:02:12.090
Harry Liu: And we don't think like, after, like a round of user interviews with like healthcare professionals from like either the clinical side or the like product side. We don't think that's the best like

23
00:02:12.790 --> 00:02:23.720
Harry Liu: tangent to tack into like the AI teleprompter thing isn't the best thing to do, because there's so much, you know, variety in terms of how people conduct interviews within the healthcare space.

24
00:02:25.340 --> 00:02:29.447
Harry Liu: But then we put it this kind of to the post interview

25
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:40.490
Harry Liu: phase, where we are now focusing on helping like product people in healthcare space. We're honestly like

26
00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:45.840
Harry Liu: brought in the broader, like just product space to synthesize their

27
00:02:45.950 --> 00:02:56.990
Harry Liu: insights from user interviews and then giving them a platform to collaborate with different stakeholders across teams. Yeah.

28
00:02:57.770 --> 00:03:17.899
Harry Liu: but definitely would love to hear a little bit more about like how you you know, we are still locking down the specific user persona of. You know what kind of healthcare organizations we are innovating, for where the size of the team and how like team internally collaborate that like is really important for us. But we would love to hear more about like, how you

29
00:03:17.900 --> 00:03:34.210
Harry Liu: kind of, you know, currently conduct product, innovation and user interviews in your organization. Most importantly, how do you kind of like, you know, make use of that information in your user interviews and share it with your team.

30
00:03:35.250 --> 00:03:36.760
Isaac Park: Hmm, okay.

31
00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.190
Isaac Park: Hi. Desiree.

32
00:03:38.190 --> 00:03:40.649
Jesirae Dong: Hi! Sorry I was late.

33
00:03:40.650 --> 00:03:41.329
Isaac Park: No, you're good.

34
00:03:41.330 --> 00:03:42.679
Jesirae Dong: Sorry about that.

35
00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:45.930
Isaac Park: Let's see.

36
00:03:46.570 --> 00:03:49.460
Isaac Park: So, Harry, are you talking specifically like

37
00:03:50.750 --> 00:03:55.000
Isaac Park: pro product people in general in healthcare? Or does it?

38
00:03:55.330 --> 00:04:08.260
Isaac Park: So okay, let me back up. So in in product, I would say, in product and in healthcare generally, the behaviors are the same. Whether you're agnostic like it's kind of agnostic to the industry. I don't.

39
00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:11.710
Isaac Park: I have not encountered very many products.

40
00:04:11.970 --> 00:04:23.548
Isaac Park: I would say pathways or workflows that would be net and unique to a healthcare scenario that I would not typically find like in a general b 2 b saas business, right?

41
00:04:25.270 --> 00:04:38.239
Isaac Park: with maybe like the added sort of component of it being a regulated industry, right where data is, is needs to be protected, but that that's not any different than any other traditional.

42
00:04:38.410 --> 00:04:52.450
Isaac Park: I would say industry vertical, where there might be some gotcha, like legal right, where compliance and security is still the kind of the same thing, or government, even life sciences, where it's going to have some degree of like regulation or compliance aspect to it, so that

43
00:04:52.920 --> 00:04:58.180
Isaac Park: it's all kind of the same same right? So there isn't anything like, I think.

44
00:04:58.600 --> 00:05:01.529
Isaac Park: magically unique about healthcare that would make it

45
00:05:02.811 --> 00:05:09.128
Isaac Park: indicative of doing a specific kind of product pathway or not. At least, that's not been my experience.

46
00:05:09.830 --> 00:05:10.940
Jesirae Dong: Okay.

47
00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:32.359
Harry Liu: I think that's good information. Yeah, like, it makes the, you know, it makes our user pool particularly bigger and just like more scalable. That's a good thing. The things we're trying to, you know, figure out like, definitely, the interview process itself can be a little bit different on the medical devices side, because, like, when you, you know, are thinking about a hardware or like an actual

48
00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:42.680
Harry Liu: equipment or a software that's used in the healthcare setting. I feel like a lot of people we talk to like they talk about the need to like, actually do shadowing

49
00:05:42.940 --> 00:05:46.189
Harry Liu: compared to just like doing like regular zoom interviews. More.

50
00:05:49.386 --> 00:05:55.839
Isaac Park: That's true, I mean, if you're if you're thinking about it from that like binary of of

51
00:05:56.180 --> 00:05:58.240
Isaac Park: hard product versus, not hard product.

52
00:05:58.420 --> 00:06:04.080
Isaac Park: right, like physical good versus not, I think that's probably the more appropriate binary like, I'm looking at it like

53
00:06:04.530 --> 00:06:08.449
Isaac Park: if the product is is software driven or software based. And that's the solution, like.

54
00:06:08.450 --> 00:06:08.940
Harry Liu: Yeah.

55
00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:12.450
Isaac Park: It's not this, it's it's all kind of the same right? That's good.

56
00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.200
Isaac Park: So

57
00:06:13.200 --> 00:06:19.899
Isaac Park: I think it'd be the same, for, like hardware, if you have a physical in person device, right? That you're that you're building product around like you probably.

58
00:06:20.010 --> 00:06:24.276
Isaac Park: but also need the same same things. Right?

59
00:06:26.350 --> 00:06:31.079
Isaac Park: yeah, I guess what I'm what would help me is like, what? What questions are you trying to get answered.

60
00:06:31.390 --> 00:06:32.260
Harry Liu: Right.

61
00:06:32.810 --> 00:06:45.649
Harry Liu: I think we are kind of already, you know, like double down this idea, because we, you know, we need to like, be cautious of the timeline. But right now we are in the design phase, like prototyping phase and a lot of our like, you know, our

62
00:06:45.780 --> 00:06:48.899
Harry Liu: questions are on how?

63
00:06:49.656 --> 00:07:07.333
Harry Liu: I guess how currently you like store and process interviews. After you conduct them and like your team dynamic. So how many people like? Where are the people who are conducting interviews? And or you know the people that are necessary that are related to

64
00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:08.850
Harry Liu: this.

65
00:07:09.200 --> 00:07:36.895
Isaac Park: Yeah, okay, so process wise we. We split it up into 2 kinds of interviews. We have existing customers that we're doing sort of just general calibration and feedback and that's part of almost like a customer operations customer delivery motion. And we do that at least right now, once a week for commercial agreements or commercial customers. And generally that person who leads that is going to be

66
00:07:37.410 --> 00:07:42.019
Isaac Park: like the customer's primary delivery person or success person.

67
00:07:42.587 --> 00:07:50.170
Isaac Park: and when we hire for delivery leads or customer, success leads, we, we pull them from like product.

68
00:07:50.580 --> 00:07:55.319
Isaac Park: right, and so generally, our customer success. People are not your typical like

69
00:07:55.690 --> 00:08:01.899
Isaac Park: customer success account accounts kind of a person where they're trying to upsell. But they're actually more like product product discovery. People

70
00:08:02.286 --> 00:08:04.260
Isaac Park: that have just been titled in that direction.

71
00:08:04.944 --> 00:08:08.420
Isaac Park: And then the flip side is more.

72
00:08:08.610 --> 00:08:19.909
Isaac Park: R&d focused if you're thinking about like a brand new net, new product. And you're doing discovery around that or brand new problem to solve. Then we have your more traditional product manager with their little team

73
00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.170
Isaac Park: going out and doing customer interviews, and and that's more ad hoc. But sometimes

74
00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:35.580
Isaac Park: sometimes it's targeted towards our existing customers. If they're the easiest ones to get to. And we know that they have that problem. Sometimes it's like asking for referrals to other people who, we, you know.

75
00:08:36.110 --> 00:08:43.829
Isaac Park: may have a connection into and recognize that they may have that problem. So that's just way more like the traditional innovation stuff that Nick are pretty familiar with.

76
00:08:44.718 --> 00:08:47.020
Isaac Park: So, yeah, those are our 2 methodologies.

77
00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:50.650
Isaac Park: terms of tooling, and what we do. Everything goes into notion.

78
00:08:51.308 --> 00:08:58.500
Isaac Park: And so the people who who run it are generally that primary product or primary customer success, individual

79
00:08:59.077 --> 00:09:04.819
Isaac Park: if we can get like our product designer or an engineer to join those meetings, we do.

80
00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.770
Isaac Park: But that's not always like feasible, considering how often they happen.

81
00:09:09.339 --> 00:09:18.879
Isaac Park: And so worst case scenario, in fact, probably the more common scenario is, it's just a solo, a solo solo person going at it. Right? So it's either

82
00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:28.000
Isaac Park: we only have. We have 1, 2, we have 3 people who who typically do them me a brand new Pm. I just hired, and a customer success person. So those are the 3 that go out.

83
00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:31.490
Isaac Park: Generally process wise.

84
00:09:31.490 --> 00:09:33.040
Jesirae Dong: As we.

85
00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:34.750
Isaac Park: -Oh!

86
00:09:35.830 --> 00:09:39.839
Isaac Park: Fire alarm. Generally stay safe.

87
00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.870
Isaac Park: Generally. What we'll do is we'll record it right using fireflies or something like that.

88
00:09:48.300 --> 00:09:56.079
Isaac Park: And then we store that recording on fireflies. We link to it, and we drop it into our notion. That doesn't happen that often, like some that's also stylistic like. Sometimes

89
00:09:56.620 --> 00:10:03.490
Isaac Park: I I tend to record them less. And some of our other team members tend to record them more like Andrew likes to record them a lot.

90
00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:23.890
Isaac Park: and then I'll just take notes and they'll synthesize right there on the fly. So I don't do the traditional like here. All my observations, blah. And then, like, here's my insight statement, and here's my need statements, or that's how we teach it. But that's not how I do it. I I just jump straight from like as I'm listening. I'm jotting down like my core insights.

91
00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:25.553
Isaac Park: And then

92
00:10:26.870 --> 00:10:29.509
Isaac Park: I almost never go back and read them unless I have a question.

93
00:10:30.460 --> 00:10:40.490
Harry Liu: I see. Yeah. Sorry. That's so like how you traditionally teaches observations inside statement. I'm just trying to track that down.

94
00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:43.570
Isaac Park: Oh, did we not? Did Pm. Not teach you that.

95
00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:46.594
Harry Liu: Probably maybe I.

96
00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:47.730
Isaac Park: Oh, yeah.

97
00:10:47.730 --> 00:10:49.700
Harry Liu: By learning. So, yeah.

98
00:10:50.070 --> 00:11:05.970
Isaac Park: One and 2 should have taught you that right where, like your traditional customer interviews, you do observation right? So all you're doing is you're just walking the people through the their last steps. You ask the how, what? Why, you should actually, Nick, Nick teaches these units right? He's like, yeah, it's the yeah, it's the

99
00:11:06.170 --> 00:11:22.889
Isaac Park: the. When was the last time? How did you do it? What was there any pain right? And then that's just observe like, it's just a crafted template for how you crank through like observation statements. And then, after you exhaustively put it all out, and then you do an insight statement, and then you translate that into need statements.

100
00:11:23.010 --> 00:11:25.700
Isaac Park: I don't. I don't do that process. I just like.

101
00:11:26.450 --> 00:11:30.260
Isaac Park: listen, ask ask questions, and then go straight to insights.

102
00:11:30.260 --> 00:11:58.769
Harry Liu: Right? Okay, there are a couple of things I am really curious about in this process. So one you talked about like the differentiation between customer success and product person is this customer success person, kind of like? If I'm understanding this correctly, like he or she is like Con, like in touch with existing customers and trying to figure out, you know what like like kind of like, how the how the team can improve these customers experiences by like customizing a few features for them.

103
00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:02.163
Isaac Park: Yeah, it's not really about customizing features. It's more about

104
00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:07.959
Isaac Park: listening to what problems they have or what they're encountering, right? Because we're we're still pretty new.

105
00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:08.580
Harry Liu: Yeah.

106
00:12:09.920 --> 00:12:14.830
Isaac Park: And while we're in retail we have pretty big commercial agreements, right? The

107
00:12:15.170 --> 00:12:36.130
Isaac Park: the experience we know the experience is not perfect or even close to ideal for our customers, and so like trying to understand what things they run into right. And the original intent was for us to start. Think we're a company. Right? So the original intent was for us tune our models to figure out like, whether whether our precision or accuracy was actually close, precision recall was actually pretty close to what the the

108
00:12:36.280 --> 00:12:43.609
Isaac Park: the commercial entities really wanted. And then what we realized was like, as we were doing, that they had like stupid things like, Oh, actually.

109
00:12:44.190 --> 00:12:46.870
Isaac Park: I just need to know when this patient was last updated.

110
00:12:47.587 --> 00:12:58.369
Isaac Park: right? So like things like that where you're like, you're just really diving into understanding the workflow and making sure that the product itself is hardened or robust enough that, you know they it.

111
00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:01.569
Isaac Park: We're not missing the things that would make their lives easier.

112
00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:08.589
Harry Liu: Right and like correct me if I'm wrong. This is a 2 b like sulfur.

113
00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:10.470
Isaac Park: Oh! What!

114
00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:12.319
Harry Liu: This is a 2 b software.

115
00:13:12.320 --> 00:13:15.350
Isaac Park: B, 2. B, yes, yeah. So we sell.

116
00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.040
Isaac Park: We sell to very, very large healthcare organizations.

117
00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:24.339
Harry Liu: Very large, as in like the healthcare systems, not like individual practices.

118
00:13:25.484 --> 00:13:28.989
Isaac Park: Yes and no. So systems are

119
00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:53.289
Isaac Park: traditionally what you would call like like Duke is a system, right? And that's where you have, like a couple of hot, maybe one multiple hospitals, ambulatory centers like a bunch of other kinds of things. You can. Those are very big. You can have groups that are just as big, but not be considered a system. Right? They're like they're called provider groups or Acos, or other kinds of like healthcare organizations, but they're they are equally as big.

120
00:13:53.570 --> 00:13:54.000
Harry Liu: Totally.

121
00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.179
Isaac Park: You just don't use the word system because it connotes a different thing.

122
00:13:57.530 --> 00:14:18.300
Harry Liu: Right sounds good. So that's good. So the customer success. People are trying to surface insights from existing customers. You're also having the traditional product person to like build new features where the people who are interviews for the new features are the like. You said. It's part of our

123
00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:21.320
Harry Liu: like existing customers, where the other part of people.

124
00:14:22.090 --> 00:14:23.804
Isaac Park: Yeah, they might be like, we're

125
00:14:24.290 --> 00:14:29.249
Isaac Park: referrals to other organizations that we know have those problems.

126
00:14:29.470 --> 00:14:30.400
Isaac Park: Young.

127
00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:40.100
Isaac Park: Yeah, that's that's about it. If there are other people that we know have that problem, but they're not an existing customer. We gotta figure out a way in right and talk to them. So

128
00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:53.519
Isaac Park: it's either either cold emailing or what happens, or what seems to be the the much more natural fit is for warm introduction. So we know that like. Say, for example, this person over.

129
00:14:53.750 --> 00:15:05.410
Isaac Park: I don't know. Over a harbor health runs an aco, but we don't know them. We just know their title right? And somebody just happened to say, Hey, you know, these guys actually have that problem. You may want to talk to them. Oh, cool! Can you send us a

130
00:15:05.550 --> 00:15:09.730
Isaac Park: a warm introduction. And they say, great, yeah. So they introduce you over email, then you just follow up.

131
00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:25.290
Harry Liu: I see and like, if your existing customer have a problem like how they report this back to you guys like, how would you guys receive kind of the do you guys do cast me out in athletics, or kind of collect feedback.

132
00:15:25.290 --> 00:15:30.100
Isaac Park: No too early for that. So there's it's more it's much

133
00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:35.840
Isaac Park: much simpler. Hang on one second.

134
00:15:44.330 --> 00:15:47.348
Isaac Park: It's much simpler than that. It's the

135
00:15:48.750 --> 00:15:55.459
Isaac Park: It's it's actually closer to like customer customer success, traditional customer success. Where you have like escalations.

136
00:15:55.933 --> 00:16:02.180
Isaac Park: you might have an issue. You report it you if it's if it's like a non urgent, non critical bug, you just

137
00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:12.104
Isaac Park: report it just sending me email, or you put it through a ticket system alright, and then, if it becomes urgent or becomes important, right? Then

138
00:16:12.670 --> 00:16:15.100
Isaac Park: During our weekly check-ins it comes up

139
00:16:15.270 --> 00:16:22.209
Isaac Park: right and we talk about it, and we talk about how to stack, rank it or prioritize it. Typically, by then we've already seen that issue. And like are are addressing it.

140
00:16:22.550 --> 00:16:28.129
Isaac Park: And if it's like a new mission critical. Right? Then somebody picks up the phone and calls us

141
00:16:28.470 --> 00:16:31.286
Isaac Park: right? And again, typically we're usually aware of them

142
00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.629
Isaac Park: and are working on it. So yeah, that's that's that's more like.

143
00:16:35.020 --> 00:16:37.531
Isaac Park: that's way, more like normal customer success.

144
00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.010
Harry Liu: Definitely. So, how do you like? Can you give examples of what our.

145
00:16:42.250 --> 00:16:55.929
Harry Liu: you know, the improvement features you can get from the customer success people. And what are the new features that you're, you know, getting from the product person like, are these defined scope, or are these just totally like

146
00:16:56.270 --> 00:16:57.700
Harry Liu: a new product.

147
00:16:58.690 --> 00:17:20.479
Isaac Park: No, it's easier for you to. I would say it's a lot easier to in the general industry like, if you ask a normal person like in, because they would tell you like, oh, no. One is much more like bug focus and product is much more R&D focus. And I don't think that's true. And this is why we've crafted our system the way we did. I think of everything as just generally a problem to be solved

148
00:17:20.599 --> 00:17:25.760
Isaac Park: right, or or you'll hear the term job to be done right and

149
00:17:26.010 --> 00:17:31.309
Isaac Park: like the source or inspiration for those problems that need to get solved can come from anywhere.

150
00:17:31.530 --> 00:17:42.610
Isaac Park: Right? Generally they're in the either in the front line area or they're in. Actually, what's what else is really common is in the sales space right as somebody as your team members are going out to try and sell

151
00:17:42.830 --> 00:17:50.100
Isaac Park: like your customers are like, Oh, can you do this? And we're like, actually, no. But why do you need that right? That kind of stuff?

152
00:17:50.550 --> 00:18:02.368
Isaac Park: in the product space is gonna come from traditionally come from like data or metrics analytics. But we're we're too early for that. There's there's only like 5 customers, right? So I mean the big customers. Right? But

153
00:18:03.170 --> 00:18:08.970
Isaac Park: yeah, there's only 5 of them. So you don't really need to watch metrics. You just need to ask them, yeah.

154
00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:16.720
Harry Liu: Totally and going back to like how you like. You know how you process your interviews. You said that you just like you kind of just.

155
00:18:16.850 --> 00:18:29.849
Harry Liu: you know, have all of these points already in mind after you like. Talk to the customer. Do you think that's because you are in the earlier stage. So it's really lean. The decision making is just like on you, or like few people.

156
00:18:30.723 --> 00:18:38.369
Isaac Park: It's a combination of things for me. It's my, my, it's a preference in the style, a stylistic preference. Just the way that I do it.

157
00:18:40.310 --> 00:18:52.439
Isaac Park: also because we're a smaller organization. And I don't have like tons of cross functional product, individuals like there's no reason for me to document it to the degree of fidelity that needs to be like communicated to other people.

158
00:18:52.690 --> 00:18:53.240
Harry Liu: Yeah.

159
00:18:53.400 --> 00:19:02.329
Isaac Park: Right, like I'd much rather me just do all the inside stuff save myself a few extra minutes, and then pull together like a quick, you know one paragraph brief.

160
00:19:02.510 --> 00:19:06.616
Isaac Park: right on the occasion. I'll throw up a bigger like a bigger thing. But

161
00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:18.040
Isaac Park: these days you I think you're starting to see that people are authoring less and less context like doc context documents. There might. They might be doing a few paragraphs here and there, but there's no like.

162
00:19:18.360 --> 00:19:24.329
Isaac Park: I don't know. I think Amazon still doing the written narrative right. But the this is one thing that I would. I'd I'd be teaching in class if I

163
00:19:24.671 --> 00:19:43.760
Isaac Park: because of the the speed at which you can get to a high fidelity, mock up now. People are just skipping straight to it right? And so it's just you have your customer interviews right? You maybe come up with a couple of insight statements, and then you just go straight to high fidelity mockup, or you skip everything in between. No customer journey, some of that projecting any of that kind of stuff, because you can, just

164
00:19:44.020 --> 00:19:50.990
Isaac Park: you can just do it. You can literally push a button and like, have a Gen. AI tool. Just mock it up for you. And then you're

165
00:19:51.310 --> 00:19:59.069
Isaac Park: your product designer can just go bang, bang, bang! Bang! Bang! And then fix it right and so your speed to iteration and speed of cycle is just way faster than it used to be.

166
00:19:59.360 --> 00:20:23.430
Harry Liu: Right? Yeah, that's 1. Also, like one thing, we are trying to figure out like the actual exact target persona, because we recognize that leaner starts probably are going to be like much more faster in terms of iteration, and having, you know, no need for documentation. I assume that, like bigger organizations. One of the bigger organizations we talk about. They have a lot of products in their portfolio, and those stakeholders.

167
00:20:23.430 --> 00:20:40.449
Harry Liu: either as product people like R&D, or like sales and marketing. They need to like collaboratively, come in to do all hands meeting, to decide on what features to build next. And in that sense. They said that they really need kind of documentation on what is said during the customer interviews. So everyone.

168
00:20:41.300 --> 00:20:42.150
Isaac Park: No.

169
00:20:42.150 --> 00:20:42.910
Harry Liu: I wouldn't.

170
00:20:42.910 --> 00:20:51.790
Isaac Park: I wouldn't say that like, if you're in an organization that's doing an all hands to come up with like your product roadmap that something's wrong. You're

171
00:20:52.010 --> 00:20:55.390
Isaac Park: your prioritization of what should be being built is

172
00:20:56.150 --> 00:21:00.400
Isaac Park: if if you're talking like true, like product operating a model like

173
00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:11.959
Isaac Park: that's in one person's head right for any scope of domain, because some product, leader or product, strategist or CEO or head of product whatever like, threw a problem over the wall and said, Hey.

174
00:21:12.140 --> 00:21:39.930
Isaac Park: I need to make sure that you know these customers are able to get from point A to Point B in less than 30 seconds. Right? I just I need to know that right? And then the product person just iterates and iterates and iterates, and they have their north star where they're headed right? So they're the one that's empowered to make all the decisions on what features gets built. Nobody cares right about how. So like there's no all hands, where, like like, they may be talking to sales, or all these other people to like, try and

175
00:21:40.170 --> 00:21:46.989
Isaac Park: get the information necessary to then make the Qb. Choice on what to do right. But there's no like

176
00:21:49.750 --> 00:22:02.410
Isaac Park: the at that point. Like the the full documentation the customer reviews is is for the product person to go back and review, not for them to like, make the argument to everyone else, or convince everyone else that this is the case right.

177
00:22:02.410 --> 00:22:02.870
Harry Liu: Okay.

178
00:22:03.118 --> 00:22:07.340
Isaac Park: That's that's in like a traditional setting, or in like the I would say, the ideal setting.

179
00:22:07.810 --> 00:22:20.180
Harry Liu: Okay, yeah. So like, we can definitely, that's a good piece of information. We can de-emphasize on collaboration part and reemphasize on the kind of like for one person's like, you know, reference purposes.

180
00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:29.879
Isaac Park: Sorry. Let me clarify. The collaboration is important right within that product team. So if there's like a product team of like 4 or 5 people. Yeah, that's important. But there's no like

181
00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:39.770
Isaac Park: there. There's no like sharing that as a broad, based knowledge, Wiki, for, like the entire organization, nobody cares about that right? Or maybe I don't know. I've I've never encountered it where it mattered.

182
00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:53.319
Harry Liu: Okay, Gotcha. So the product team, like there might be a team of people who are like all working on the same product. Or they're, you know, they're all kind of interviewing people. They need to synthesize these user interviews after they come back to the team.

183
00:22:53.670 --> 00:23:03.960
Isaac Park: Yeah, I think it's a lot easier to think about it as like the product, people are not like sitting there like developing features. They're they're given a roadmap of problems they have to solve.

184
00:23:04.427 --> 00:23:14.306
Isaac Park: Right? So it's always much. It's much easier to think about it from the perspective of like yeah, this team. They've been tasked to solve that problem, this team. They've been tasked to solve that problem right?

185
00:23:15.590 --> 00:23:28.870
Isaac Park: and so right, the set of features that they're paying attention to, to stack rank or force rank. What they're developing doesn't matter right? So if if it ever becomes like a conversation around like, oh, no, I need to do

186
00:23:29.510 --> 00:23:36.240
Isaac Park: this protocol first, st then this protocol, second, then this one like somebody. Somebody, broke the philosophy of how they're doing this work.

187
00:23:36.939 --> 00:23:46.509
Harry Liu: Okay, Gotcha. Let me actually show you like a quick mock up of what you're trying to do and there are a few questions like on the granular level.

188
00:23:46.860 --> 00:23:49.160
Harry Liu: Love to get your opinion.

189
00:24:21.130 --> 00:24:22.539
Harry Liu: Can you see my screen.

190
00:24:23.610 --> 00:24:24.190
Isaac Park: Yeah.

191
00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:30.829
Harry Liu: Okay, sounds good. Yeah, this is a really like

192
00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:59.580
Harry Liu: baseline are thinking. And I think to our point, like, so currently, the flow goes like this. You have, like all your dashboard items, you have your projects which is defined in scope, and then you can go into these products and see what are the recent interviews are as well as top features that are requested that the system surface from these interview transcript. So for each interview you can see.

193
00:24:59.580 --> 00:25:16.089
Harry Liu: you know, once you upload the Transcript, you can see the information summary, the transcript highlighted with like most important talking points, and then they will like help. You come up to the list of pain points mentioned in this interview, as well as key demands.

194
00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.050
Isaac Park: Are this getting generated.

195
00:25:19.426 --> 00:25:24.189
Harry Liu: These, these are like, basically like Lm processing of the inner transcript.

196
00:25:24.190 --> 00:25:28.079
Isaac Park: So you just prompted to ask it. For what are the pain points and what are the key? Demands.

197
00:25:28.450 --> 00:25:35.759
Harry Liu: Yeah, these are like working a little bit more on the back end side, like our engineers. Our builders are like trying to figure out how to better prompt them. But yeah.

198
00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:37.330
Isaac Park: Okay. Alright.

199
00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.509
Isaac Park: Alright. Keep going.

200
00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:56.569
Harry Liu: And then, like, we're syncing like, we don't know whether this is helpful. But we're right now thinking also, like a user behavior map, like kind of like. If customers are talking about how they are. Currently, you know, using a system or currently like solving a problem. They're like, you know, walking

201
00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:18.610
Harry Liu: like their processes, current user satisfaction based on their like kind of mood. And then, like any team notes to add and when you like, you know, identify a demand. There is a sensitization of like what this demand is, where it is surfaced like across interviews and comments. We were thinking about this team importance score just for, like

202
00:26:18.730 --> 00:26:28.709
Harry Liu: like cross team and kind of collaboration. But like, I think, your to your point, this isn't necessary. This is this isn't what we're trying to reward, we should focus on.

203
00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:35.140
Harry Liu: But yeah, okay, going back.

204
00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:37.560
Harry Liu: Which page were you trying to look at?

205
00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.270
Isaac Park: Projects. Yeah, that's fine. No, yeah. Go to one of them. Go to natural interview.

206
00:26:49.450 --> 00:26:51.109
Isaac Park: Where's the transcript coming from.

207
00:26:52.180 --> 00:27:05.490
Harry Liu: So the transcript is uploaded. So basically, like the 1st iteration, we're trying to just have our users upload their zoom like a zoom recorded transcript is gonna upload on the front page.

208
00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:12.860
Isaac Park: Okay.

209
00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:14.070
Harry Liu: Yeah.

210
00:27:16.670 --> 00:27:17.910
Isaac Park: I guess, or.

211
00:27:17.910 --> 00:27:19.110
Harry Liu: Alright. Go ahead. Yeah.

212
00:27:19.420 --> 00:27:24.130
Harry Liu: Would love to hear your overall feedback on this, and we have a couple of questions.

213
00:27:25.230 --> 00:27:34.840
Isaac Park: Yeah. I, I see like getting the transcript in the video in there. And my primary source is a huge speed bump. I would never use this unless, like.

214
00:27:34.950 --> 00:27:43.399
Isaac Park: I could just turn it on like, I'm so used to using like recording or dictation or scribe software. But I would never use this unless like

215
00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:55.820
Isaac Park: it, just auto piped in right? So if I just clicked like, if my fireflies person just came in automatically or had a zoom, app, or whatever, and then it was just literally transcribing it on the fly, and then doing this in that, like I could watch it

216
00:27:56.040 --> 00:28:02.179
Isaac Park: do the system integration and synthesis that would be really important to me. The reason why is cause like

217
00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:09.179
Isaac Park: any really great interviewers building a mental model of like the memory of that interview.

218
00:28:09.695 --> 00:28:28.970
Isaac Park: Right? And it's going to be built on the fly while they are participating in that interview. So I'm remembering like, roughly this time space. This person said this roughly, this time space. This person said this, and my visual memory has captured where they are in the screen, like blah blah blah and like, that's how I'm remembering it.

219
00:28:29.497 --> 00:28:40.229
Isaac Park: So it's gonna require an extra amount of effort for me to come back in here right? And then, like, be like, Oh, okay, system integration. Great. Where was that? Right? So it's just a little bit more like speed. Bump, hurdle, scroll down.

220
00:28:40.710 --> 00:28:42.100
Harry Liu: That's an amazing point. Yeah.

221
00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.639
Isaac Park: I would never trust it to give me key demands.

222
00:28:45.530 --> 00:28:46.060
Harry Liu: Okay.

223
00:28:46.610 --> 00:28:49.299
Isaac Park: Yeah, cause the whole point of right.

224
00:28:49.830 --> 00:28:59.070
Isaac Park: The whole point of a product person is their ability to be outside constraints and to really offer some degree of creativity.

225
00:28:59.170 --> 00:29:29.129
Isaac Park: So pain points is great. Right? Like synthesizing what those pain points are that's fantastic. Find pain points that I didn't understand before. I didn't see before. So good, right? Solving those pain points is not my AI, it's not the AI job, right? Maybe it gives me some suggestions and I could be okay with it if it gave me suggestions. But if I wasn't able to edit it, or add more or fluidly chapter notes right? That then I would feel too boxed in to care right to use it.

226
00:29:29.749 --> 00:29:36.229
Isaac Park: The user behavior map. If it were accurate, I would love it. If not, I'd it's probably faster for me to just do it myself.

227
00:29:36.390 --> 00:29:38.039
Harry Liu: Yeah. Scroll down.

228
00:29:39.761 --> 00:29:43.190
Isaac Park: And then that satisfaction thing I

229
00:29:45.730 --> 00:30:05.749
Isaac Park: I don't wouldn't know it like I wouldn't know what to do with it right? Because, like the whole point of of like a a larger customer interview that may be like 34 like, even in this conversation, like how many times have I fluctuated in terms of like what I liked and what I haven't liked. Alright, and my emotions are going to be tied to that particular unit of thing that I'm talking about in that moment.

230
00:30:06.150 --> 00:30:13.100
Isaac Park: Alright. So give me a simplistic like frowny face is going to be meaningless to you, right meaningless to the product person.

231
00:30:13.550 --> 00:30:14.300
Harry Liu: Yeah, that's.

232
00:30:14.300 --> 00:30:33.873
Isaac Park: Right like, what the hell does that mean? Right? So it. It's only useful if it's tied to like that particular insight or that particular step in the user behavior or whatever. So that while the intent is interesting, like the artifact itself, it doesn't communicate enough information for me to give a shit about it.

233
00:30:35.460 --> 00:30:36.740
Harry Liu: That is amazing.

234
00:30:37.518 --> 00:30:40.100
Isaac Park: As well team notes. I don't know.

235
00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:41.200
Harry Liu: As I said, Yeah.

236
00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:42.540
Isaac Park: Okay, yeah, I

237
00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:48.299
Isaac Park: cool. I team notes as a side as an aside, if they're not tied to like

238
00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:55.819
Isaac Park: the one major thing here is. If this is not tied to any of my not like existing knowledge infrastructure, I would probably never use it.

239
00:30:56.401 --> 00:31:00.489
Isaac Park: So there's some like table stake stuff there. That might might be really interesting.

240
00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:01.360
Isaac Park: Okay.

241
00:31:02.390 --> 00:31:06.600
Harry Liu: Yeah, how would you want it to tie to like, for example, notion that you're currently using

242
00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:09.280
Harry Liu: like, what information you want.

243
00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:12.309
Isaac Park: I'd want all of this dumped straight into a notion page.

244
00:31:13.290 --> 00:31:14.109
Harry Liu: Okay, so.

245
00:31:14.110 --> 00:31:26.110
Isaac Park: Right cause. I have area. I have an area, a discrete team space with a set of meeting notes that are specifically for customer interviews right? Based on who I'm talking to, like my attendees are their time all my like. It's connected to my Crm, so all of my like.

246
00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:36.479
Isaac Park: it's attached to the people that I'm talking to, which, you know, brings in all of the organization, like the larger manage account. How big they are, what like.

247
00:31:36.720 --> 00:31:54.960
Isaac Park: what Cms models they participate in. Right? So all the sort of like external, enriched data that help me understand who is the persona that I'm talking to, like it's all there, right. So if this is divorced from that, then I have to make that reconciliation happen manually, and if I'm doing a fun of these interviews. It's a pain in the ass.

248
00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:08.259
Harry Liu: Totally okay, that's great. So you want this system to effectively capture from our hearing, like the facts of the user persona that you're interviewing like how big their team is like, what pain points they

249
00:32:08.730 --> 00:32:09.659
Harry Liu: stuff like that.

250
00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:23.069
Isaac Park: Yeah, yeah, well, like that, knowledge infrastructure already exists. Right? So for me to abandon, like my my current behavior, which is just taking notes and notion. To use this right, it would need to be significantly better, right? And then

251
00:32:23.170 --> 00:32:29.149
Isaac Park: than what I'm currently doing or the value that I get out of like just being able to catalog all my data in notion in one place, right.

252
00:32:29.150 --> 00:32:40.249
Harry Liu: Gotcha amazing! Can you like walk me through like you were like what you were thinking when you were doing interview? So you said that, you know, during interview user interview, like you kind of already, have.

253
00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:44.425
Harry Liu: like the key points in your mind on the go.

254
00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:56.889
Harry Liu: I was wondering how that looks like, and if you were to your point to transition this from a dashboard of itself to more so like a pop up or a plugin for your notion

255
00:32:57.260 --> 00:33:02.169
Harry Liu: or for zoom. We are conducting user interviews. How would it look like.

256
00:33:03.070 --> 00:33:10.020
Isaac Park: Yeah, honestly, if it were headless, I would love that right. So if it were a zoom plugin that just sat there and then.

257
00:33:10.538 --> 00:33:29.961
Isaac Park: It literally authored the transcription and then summarize some key insights on the notion page that are already set up for this particular interview. That'd be fantastic right, just sitting there and like plugging away. And then all I have to do is do some synthesis at the very end, or like editing or note taking. That's that's that's great.

258
00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:30.690
Harry Liu: Yeah.

259
00:33:30.690 --> 00:33:32.460
Isaac Park: As it like links to.

260
00:33:33.670 --> 00:33:38.980
Isaac Park: But that that's really just transcription software, right? Like, that's.

261
00:33:39.150 --> 00:33:44.499
Isaac Park: I think what I'm struggling with is like, what is the problem to be solved with this particular like product?

262
00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:58.170
Isaac Park: And I'm I'm kind of giving you a hard time, because I actually know, I know, like Nick and quick. And I know, Steven, I know the product. I know where they're headed right? And so like, yeah, there's a there there, but it's

263
00:33:58.350 --> 00:34:00.640
Isaac Park: it's it's not necessarily like.

264
00:34:00.950 --> 00:34:01.500
Harry Liu: Yeah.

265
00:34:01.690 --> 00:34:06.369
Isaac Park: If you limit it to just like as a plugin for transcription and customer interviews where there's not enough right.

266
00:34:06.740 --> 00:34:27.920
Harry Liu: Yeah, fully. We'll probably think about this a little bit with our value added. But if you do want to be mindful time, I guess the last question I have is like, so I'm struggling on. How like this project thing will like fit into the scope, because, like as you talk about like some things are improvements on existing products. Some things might be, you know, new. I was wondering like, how

267
00:34:28.070 --> 00:34:29.270
Harry Liu: how would you

268
00:34:29.699 --> 00:34:41.979
Harry Liu: want this to be, you know, presented. Do you want to like set up defined products? And then, like, you know, adding each interview to a product? Or do you want this to just be more of a like not defined thing.

269
00:34:42.239 --> 00:34:46.679
Isaac Park: Yeah, it's gonna be many to many. And it's gonna be problems to interviews.

270
00:34:46.889 --> 00:34:49.249
Isaac Park: Yeah, right? I would.

271
00:34:49.519 --> 00:34:52.429
Isaac Park: I again, I hate that language of project.

272
00:34:52.629 --> 00:34:53.194
Harry Liu: Yeah.

273
00:34:53.909 --> 00:34:59.729
Isaac Park: Like in my business. This is basically what we call we call them journeys.

274
00:35:00.730 --> 00:35:29.119
Isaac Park: Right and we use that language as as a nod to sort of the the semantics of agile software. Right? So agile software you have like a task. And then you have a story, right? Because everything's a narrative. And above story. You have an epic, right? Because every again, everything is a narrative, right? And so for us like, then the next. The next narrative, ontology higher, we just came up with, like typically in the regular world is initiative, but for us we just started calling them journeys.

275
00:35:29.578 --> 00:35:33.979
Harry Liu: Right and for, and we have pretty strict discipline around the journeys being.

276
00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:42.028
Isaac Park: Defined problems. Right? So like, my problem might be

277
00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.200
Isaac Park: I don't know.

278
00:35:45.110 --> 00:35:49.970
Isaac Park: Demo experience needs to close pilot on 1st call.

279
00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:57.740
Isaac Park: Right? That's like a defined problem. Right? With a defined outcome metric less

280
00:35:58.140 --> 00:36:03.830
Isaac Park: less projecty right? But as an as a but

281
00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:14.510
Isaac Park: as an ontology. Great? Yeah, that's okay, right? That that you have this concept. And then you have a bunch of customer interviews. But it is many to many. Right? So like, I could have 15 problems.

282
00:36:14.650 --> 00:36:21.330
Isaac Park: Alright. And I could have a thousand interviews. And each interview might have information that's useful for multiple of those problems.

283
00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:24.910
Harry Liu: Yeah, okay, that's

284
00:36:25.230 --> 00:36:30.610
Harry Liu: great. So maybe we can create tags instead compared to like defining them on under a product.

285
00:36:31.040 --> 00:36:40.209
Isaac Park: Yeah. But the the major pain here isn't like, if you're gonna do tags, that's like just more work for the product person to do like it needs to do it automatically.

286
00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:49.750
Harry Liu: Yeah, exactly. So, one interview might like be related to like multiple projects in this case. And then

287
00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:56.519
Harry Liu: one project, yeah, like, that's true. One project might have a lot of interviews. Okay? Sounds good. That's really interesting information.

288
00:36:56.940 --> 00:36:58.187
Isaac Park: I have to bounce

289
00:36:58.790 --> 00:37:03.060
Isaac Park: Sorry for for cutting us off. Of course.

290
00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:09.859
Isaac Park: Sorry, Harry, I gotta go. I got another call to go, Desiree. It's a pleasure to meet you. I know we didn't get a chance to really chat, but.

291
00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:14.509
Jesirae Dong: Yeah, yeah, I had some questions. But it's okay. I can just reach out afterwards.

292
00:37:14.510 --> 00:37:16.740
Isaac Park: Do you have a question? I can do one question.

293
00:37:16.740 --> 00:37:29.950
Jesirae Dong: So I was thinking, like you were talking about like Job to be done right. And I was thinking like, if we should, if incorporating that like synthesizing insights, for example, like Job to be done instead of like you know.

294
00:37:29.950 --> 00:37:30.540
Isaac Park: Yeah.

295
00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:36.019
Jesirae Dong: Like like solutions, like actual solutions. Would that be helpful.

296
00:37:36.357 --> 00:37:43.790
Isaac Park: Sort of like, I said. I don't actually use jt, Jtd, it's a useful like way to to interrogate something.

297
00:37:48.910 --> 00:37:59.159
Isaac Park: Yeah, it's useful. I find it. It's a useful way to interrogate something, I think, what you'll you'll encounter. I mean, it's popular, right? But I think what you'll encounter is that some people don't give a shit about that heuristic, or that that like framework.

298
00:37:59.390 --> 00:38:13.590
Isaac Park: and if you force them into that like framework. You'll lose them right like. If if I came into here and it were like forced, it would like really forced me into my jobs to be done, I'd be like, Oh, fuck that right. I wouldn't.

299
00:38:14.070 --> 00:38:18.010
Isaac Park: Right I and I think your product people are going to be cut from a cloth that are much more

300
00:38:19.890 --> 00:38:23.119
Isaac Park: interested in flexibility right than other people are.

301
00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:27.690
Jesirae Dong: Okay. Okay, yeah, that's a, that's a really good point. Cool. Thank you.

302
00:38:28.380 --> 00:38:29.670
Harry Liu: Yep, alright!

303
00:38:29.670 --> 00:38:30.200
Harry Liu: Got it.

304
00:38:30.390 --> 00:38:31.250
Jesirae Dong: Nice. Okay.

305
00:38:31.250 --> 00:38:31.860
Harry Liu: Have a good one.

306
00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:32.870
Isaac Park: That's Budget. Yep.

307
00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:37.935
Harry Liu: Alright!
