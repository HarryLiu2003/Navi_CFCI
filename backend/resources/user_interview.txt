00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.930
Nicholas Piazza: Hi Sarah, can you hear me okay?

2
00:00:04.330 --> 00:00:07.529
Sarah Chen: Yes, I can hear you. Just adjusting my headset real quick.

3
00:00:08.130 --> 00:00:15.840
Nicholas Piazza: Perfect. Thanks so much for making time today. I know how busy it gets in the CCU. How's your morning been so far?

4
00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:31.560
Sarah Chen: Oh, busy as always. Had a full unit last night, and we're still at capacity. But that's actually good timing for this discussion because we've been dealing with some challenges with the monitoring systems, especially during shift changes.

5
00:00:32.100 --> 00:00:42.300
Nicholas Piazza: That's exactly what we want to learn more about. Could you walk me through a typical shift change and how you're using our monitoring systems?

6
00:00:42.800 --> 00:01:12.450
Sarah Chen: Sure. So during shift change, we have to manage about 24 patients in our unit, all on continuous cardiac monitoring. We're using your CardioWatch system for most patients, and some are also on the older ECG units. The main challenge is that these don't talk to each other well. When we're handing off patients, we have to log into multiple systems to get a complete picture of a patient's cardiac status over the past 12 hours.

7
00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:20.200
Nicholas Piazza: Could you give me a specific example of what that workflow looks like?

8
00:01:20.700 --> 00:02:00.300
Sarah Chen: Yes, let me walk you through what happened just this morning. We had a patient who showed some arrhythmia on the CardioWatch around 3 AM. The night nurse had to document this in our EMR, but when we tried to pull up the specific waveform during rounds, we had to switch to your separate CardioAnalytics portal. Then, because this patient also had a 12-lead ECG done at 6 AM, that data was in yet another system. It took us about 15 minutes just to piece together the complete cardiac event timeline for one patient.

9
00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:10.200
Nicholas Piazza: That sounds frustrating. How often do you need to cross-reference data between these different systems?

10
00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:45.400
Sarah Chen: Multiple times every shift. And it's not just about viewing the data - it's about the alerts too. The CardioWatch will send alerts to our phones, but the ECG system only shows alerts on the central station monitor. Sometimes we get duplicate alerts, sometimes we miss alerts because they're only showing in one system. Our newer nurses especially struggle with this because they have to learn multiple systems just to monitor one patient's cardiac status.

11
00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:55.300
Nicholas Piazza: What impact does this have on patient care? Can you walk me through a scenario where this has been particularly challenging?

12
00:02:55.800 --> 00:03:45.600
Sarah Chen: Well, last week we had a complex case - a post-CABG patient who was showing intermittent ST changes. The CardioWatch caught some subtle changes, but because it doesn't automatically sync with the 12-lead ECG data, we didn't immediately notice a pattern developing. When the patient became symptomatic, we had to manually review data from both systems to show the progression to the cardiac team. Don't get me wrong - we caught it and the patient is fine, but it would have been much easier if we had one unified system. Plus, when we did our quality review afterward, compiling all the cardiac monitoring data from different timestamps and systems took hours.

13
00:03:46.100 --> 00:03:55.200
Nicholas Piazza: That's really helpful context. How do you currently handle alert settings across these different systems?

14
00:03:55.700 --> 00:04:35.900
Sarah Chen: That's another pain point. Each system has its own alert parameters. The CardioWatch is more customizable, which is great, but then those settings don't carry over to the ECG system. So if we adjust parameters for a patient who's in chronic AFib, for example, we have to remember to change it in multiple places. And when we transfer patients between units, all these settings reset. I'd say our nurses spend at least 30 minutes per shift just managing alert settings.

15
00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:45.300
Nicholas Piazza: And what about the mobile aspect of the CardioWatch? How is that working for your team?

16
00:04:45.800 --> 00:05:30.500
Sarah Chen: The mobile app is actually one of the better features. Being able to see waveforms on our phones is huge, especially when we're in isolation rooms or away from the central station. But there are still some limitations. Like, we can view the real-time data, but we can't access the trending data from the past 24 hours on mobile. And when we need to document something we saw on mobile, we still have to go back to a workstation to access the full system. Plus, the app sometimes logs us out randomly, which is really inconvenient when you're in the middle of patient care.

17
00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:40.200
Nicholas Piazza: How long does it typically take to log back in when that happens?

18
00:05:40.700 --> 00:06:20.400
Sarah Chen: The login itself is quick, maybe 30 seconds, but because of our hospital's security requirements, we often have to go through two-factor authentication again. And if you're in an isolation room in full PPE, having to take out your phone to get a security code is really disruptive. We've had nurses miss important alerts because they got logged out and couldn't quickly get back in. Some nurses have just started carrying their tablets instead of relying on the mobile app, which kind of defeats the purpose.

19
00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:35.300
Nicholas Piazza: That's a great point about the PPE situation. I hadn't thought about that. Could you tell me more about how you use the analytics features in both systems?

20
00:06:35.800 --> 00:07:25.600
Sarah Chen: The analytics capabilities are quite different between the systems. CardioWatch has some nice trending features, especially for arrhythmia tracking. But the ECG system is more basic - it really just stores the waveforms without much analysis. What we really need is something that can analyze data across both systems. For example, if a patient has been on continuous monitoring for three days, we want to easily see all cardiac events, regardless of which device captured them. Right now, preparing reports for cardiac team rounds means screenshots from multiple systems and manually creating timelines in Excel. It's time-consuming and there's always a risk of missing something.

21
00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:35.200
Nicholas Piazza: And how do the physicians feel about having to access multiple systems?

22
00:07:35.700 --> 00:08:15.900
Sarah Chen: Oh, they hate it. Most of them just rely on us nurses to compile everything for them. Dr. Martinez, our chief of cardiology, was just complaining about this last week. He wants to be able to quickly review a patient's cardiac status from home when he's on call, but right now that means multiple logins and switching between different interfaces. Sometimes he'll just ask us to text him screenshots because it's faster than logging into everything. Obviously, that's not ideal from a security standpoint.

23
00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:25.300
Nicholas Piazza: What about training new staff on these systems? How do you handle that?

24
00:08:25.800 --> 00:09:15.500
Sarah Chen: Training is actually one of our biggest challenges. New nurses already have so much to learn, and now we have to train them on multiple monitoring systems with different interfaces, different alert parameters, different documentation requirements. We've created our own quick-reference guides because the official training materials don't address how to coordinate between the systems. And when we get floating nurses from other units, they might be familiar with one system but not the other. We usually have to assign an experienced nurse to buddy with them just to help manage the monitoring systems.

25
00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:30.200
Nicholas Piazza: If you could wave a magic wand and change anything about these systems, what would be your top priorities?

26
00:09:30.700 --> 00:10:20.400
Sarah Chen: First would definitely be integration - one system that handles both continuous monitoring and 12-lead ECGs, with a single login and consistent interface. Second would be better mobile functionality that stays logged in and gives us access to all the same features we have at the workstation. And third would be smarter analytics that can help us spot trends and patterns across all the cardiac data. We spend so much time just trying to piece together information that the system should be correlating for us automatically.

27
00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:35.300
Nicholas Piazza: Those are really helpful insights. What about data export and sharing with other departments? How does that work currently?

28
00:10:35.800 --> 00:11:25.600
Sarah Chen: That's another pain point. Each system has different export formats. When we need to send data to another hospital for a transfer patient, or even just to our own cardiology clinic for outpatient follow-up, it's a whole process. The CardioWatch exports as PDFs, but the ECG system uses its own proprietary format. Sometimes we end up just printing everything and scanning it back in, which is ridiculous in 2025. And don't even get me started on trying to get the data into research databases - our clinical research team has basically given up on trying to automate data collection from these systems.

29
00:11:26.100 --> 00:11:40.200
Nicholas Piazza: How do you handle device maintenance and troubleshooting across the different systems?

30
00:11:40.700 --> 00:12:30.900
Sarah Chen: We have separate biomedical teams for each system, if you can believe it. If we have an issue with the CardioWatch, we call one team, but for the ECG system, it's a different process entirely. And sometimes they blame each other when there are integration issues. Last month, we had a problem where the CardioWatch wasn't sending data to our EMR, and we spent two days with different teams pointing fingers at each other before someone figured out it was a simple network setting. Meanwhile, we were doing double documentation for dozens of patients.

31
00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:45.300
Nicholas Piazza: That sounds really inefficient. How do you handle downtime or system updates?

32
00:12:45.800 --> 00:13:35.500
Sarah Chen: System updates are a nightmare because they never happen at the same time. The CardioWatch will have an update that takes it offline for an hour, then the next week the ECG system has an update. Each time, we have to modify our workflows and sometimes go back to paper charting. And because the systems are on different update schedules, we often run into compatibility issues after one system updates but the other hasn't. We've learned to be really cautious about installing updates until we're sure both systems have been tested together.

33
00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:50.200
Nicholas Piazza: What about inventory management for the different monitoring equipment? How do you handle that?

34
00:13:50.700 --> 00:14:40.400
Sarah Chen: We actually have separate supply chains for each system. Different vendors, different ordering processes, different par levels to maintain. The CardioWatch uses those disposable electrodes that are specific to your system, while the ECG machines use standard electrodes. But we have to keep both in stock, and they're stored in different supply rooms. It would be so much simpler if we could standardize on one type of electrode. And tracking usage is complicated because we're pulling supplies from different systems - it makes it hard to predict what we'll need and optimize our inventory levels.

35
00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:55.300
Nicholas Piazza: I see. And what about cost tracking and billing? How do these different systems impact that process?

36
00:14:55.800 --> 00:15:45.600
Sarah Chen: Each system generates its own charges, which then have to be reconciled by our billing department. Sometimes we end up with duplicate charges because both systems recorded the same monitoring period. And some insurance companies have specific requirements about documentation for cardiac monitoring, so we have to make sure we're capturing the right data in the right format from each system. Our billing compliance team regularly audits our documentation, and they're always finding discrepancies between the two systems that we have to investigate and correct.

37
00:15:46.100 --> 00:16:00.200
Nicholas Piazza: How do you handle patient education about the monitoring systems?

38
00:16:00.700 --> 00:16:50.900
Sarah Chen: That's actually gotten more complicated too. Patients notice they have different types of monitors and electrodes on, and they ask questions about why they need both. We have different patient education materials for each system, and sometimes the instructions conflict with each other. Like, the CardioWatch materials tell patients they can shower with the electrodes on, but the ECG system requires electrode changes after bathing. It can be confusing for patients and families.

39
00:16:51.400 --> 00:17:05.300
Nicholas Piazza: What about data security and privacy? How do you manage that across the systems?

40
00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:55.500
Sarah Chen: Each system has its own security protocols and audit trails. For HIPAA compliance, we have to monitor access logs from both systems, and our privacy officer has to maintain separate compliance documentation for each. When we had a privacy audit last year, it took weeks to compile all the required documentation because we had to pull reports from both systems and manually cross-reference them. And if we need to lock down a patient's record for privacy concerns, we have to remember to do it in both places.

41
00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:10.200
Nicholas Piazza: That's really comprehensive feedback, Sarah. Is there anything else you think we should know about your experience with these systems?

42
00:18:10.700 --> 00:19:00.400
Sarah Chen: Well, I think the main thing is just that we need these systems to work together better. Our nurses are skilled clinicians who should be focusing on patient care, not wrestling with technology. Every minute we spend switching between systems or reconciling data is a minute we're not at the bedside. And while both systems have their strong points - like the CardioWatch's mobile features and the ECG system's reliability - trying to use them together creates so many unnecessary complications. We need a solution that simplifies our workflow rather than adding to it.

43
00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:15.300
Nicholas Piazza: This has been incredibly helpful, Sarah. Would it be okay if we followed up with you once we have some potential solutions to these issues?

44
00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:45.500
Sarah Chen: Of course! We'd be happy to provide feedback on any improvements. And if you need to observe our workflow firsthand, you're welcome to come shadow our team. Just let me know in advance so I can coordinate with our unit manager and infection control.

45
00:19:46.000 --> 00:20:00.200
Nicholas Piazza: Perfect, I'll definitely take you up on that. Thank you so much for your time today.

46
00:20:00.700 --> 00:20:05.900
Sarah Chen: You're welcome! Looking forward to seeing what solutions you come up with.
