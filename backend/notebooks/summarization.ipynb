      " The interview with Sarah Chen, a nurse at a critical care unit (CCU), provides valuable insights into the challenges and pain points associated with using multiple monitoring systems for continuous cardiac monitoring (CCM). The systems in question are the CardioWatch and the ECG system, which are used to monitor patients with various cardiac conditions.\n",
      "\n",
      "One of the main challenges that Sarah faces is the lack of integration between the two systems. This means that she has to log into multiple systems to view a patient's cardiac status, which can be time-consuming and prone to errors. Additionally, the systems use different alert parameters, which can lead to confusion and missed alerts.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah also mentions the difficulty of managing alert settings across the different systems. Each system has its own alert parameters, which means that nurses have to remember to adjust them for each patient. This can be especially challenging for new nurses who are still learning the systems.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another issue that Sarah faces is the lack of mobile functionality in the systems. While the CardioWatch has a mobile app, it does not have all the features of the full system, and the ECG system does not have a mobile app at all. This means that nurses often have to go back to a workstation to access the full system, which can be disruptive, especially during shift changes.\n",
      "\n",
      "Sarah also mentions the challenges of data export and sharing with other departments. Each system uses different export formats, which can make it difficult to share data with other hospitals or research databases.\n",
      "\n",
      "Overall, the interview highlights the need for better integration and mobile functionality in the monitoring systems used in critical care units. Nurses should be able to access all the necessary data and features from a single system, and the systems should be designed to work together seamlessly.\n"
